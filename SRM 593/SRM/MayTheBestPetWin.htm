<html><body bgcolor="#000000" text="#ffffff"><table><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Problem Statement</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td>The pony Rainbow Dash wants to choose her pet.
There are N animals who want to be her pet.
Rainbow Dash numbered them 0 through N-1.<br></br><br></br>

To help her make the decision, Rainbow Dash decided to organize a relay race for the animals.
The race track is already known, and for each animal we know how fast it is.
More precisely, you are given vector &lt;int&gt;s <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> with the following meaning:
For each i, the animal number i will take between <b>A</b>[i] and <b>B</b>[i] seconds (inclusive) to complete the track.<br></br><br></br>

For the race the animals will be divided into two competing teams.
This is a relay race, so the team members of each team will all run the same track, one after another --
when the first team member finishes, the second one may start, and so on.
Thus the total time in which a team completes the race is the sum of the times of all team members.
Note that we can use the estimates given by <b>A</b> and <b>B</b> to estimate the total time for any team of animals.<br></br><br></br>

Given two teams S and T, the value maxdiff(S,T) is defined as the largest possible difference in seconds
between the time in which team S finishes the course and the time in which team T finishes the course.<br></br><br></br>

Rainbow Dash now needs to assign each of the animals to one of the two competing teams.
She wants to see a close competition, so she wants the teams to finish as close to each other as possible.
Formally, she wants to divide all animals into teams S and T in a way that minimizes maxdiff(S,T).
Return the smallest possible value of maxdiff(S,T).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Definition</h3></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td>Class:</td><td>MayTheBestPetWin</td></tr><tr><td>Method:</td><td>calc</td></tr><tr><td>Parameters:</td><td>vector &lt;int&gt;, vector &lt;int&gt;</td></tr><tr><td>Returns:</td><td>int</td></tr><tr><td>Method signature:</td><td>int calc(vector &lt;int&gt; A, vector &lt;int&gt; B)</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2">(be sure your method is public)</td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Notes</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>The teams are not required to contain the same number of animals.</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Constraints</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>A</b> will contain between 2 and 50 elements, inclusive.<br></br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td><b>A</b> and <b>B</b> will contain the same number of elements.<br></br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>Each element of <b>A</b> will be between 1 and 10,000, inclusive.<br></br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>Each element of <b>B</b> will be between 1 and 10,000, inclusive.<br></br></td></tr><tr><td align="center" valign="top">-</td><td>For each i, <b>B</b>[i] will be greater than or equal to <b>A</b>[i].</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><h3>Examples</h3></td></tr><tr><td align="center" nowrap="true">0)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td><table><tr><td><pre>{3,4,4,7}</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>{3,4,4,7}</pre></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><pre>Returns: 2</pre></td></tr><tr><td><table><tr><td colspan="2">In this test case we know the exact time in which each of the animals completes the track.
An optimal solution is to choose teams S={0,3} and T={1,2}.
Then team S will certainly complete the track in 3+7 = 10 seconds, and team T in 4+4 = 8 seconds.
Thus, maxdiff(S,T)=2.</td></tr></table></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td align="center" nowrap="true">1)</td><td></td></tr><tr><td>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;</td><td><table><tr><td><table><tr><td><pre>{1,3,5,4,5}</pre></td></tr><tr><td><pre>{2,5,6,8,7}</pre></td></tr></table></td></tr><tr><td><pre>Returns: 5</pre></td></tr><tr><td><table><tr><td colspan="2">Here one of the optimal solutions is S={2,3} and T={0,1,4}.
